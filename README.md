# asr33-irc

This is an IRC client for teletype terminals.

You can use this with your printer - a monitor-free IRC environment.

Inspiration: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/lpsh

The idea is
1. you connect your [EPSON LX 350 dot matrix](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Impact-Dot-Matrix/LX-350-Impact-Dot-Matrix-Printer/p/C11CC24001) printer to your Raspberry Pi
2. run https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/lpsh
3. from lpsh run asr33-irc
4. chat in IRC with a keyboard and a dot matrix printer

that's it
